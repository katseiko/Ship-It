# Ship-It
Program to track different parcels, letters and shipments across several tracking API providers.

## Planned Tracking Providers
I would like the program to allow tracking for the most common tracking providers across Central Europe and the USA/Canada:
- DHL
- FedEx
- UPS
- GLS
- Deutsche Post Mail
- DPD

Suggestions for additional providers and their trackers are welcome.

## Technology
In order to make this program available for Android, iOS and Windows with a common code base on C#, this project will use the **Xamarin Framework**.

## Branching
Work will be done mainly on the _master_ branch, new tracking providers will be initially added on a _feature_ branch that will be merged into the master branch after review.
